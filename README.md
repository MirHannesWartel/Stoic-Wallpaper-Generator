# Stoic Wallpaper Generator

This program selects a random excerpt from Marcus Aurelius "meditations" and adds it as the desktop backround. 
Use the windows installer to Automaticly add the program to autostart. 
The program does not require python to be installed.
This is my first program im releasing to the public. There should be alot of room for improvment.  
So please, report any bugs you come across, and take a look at the sourc code located in the "lib/AutoMediditationsWallpaper" folder
